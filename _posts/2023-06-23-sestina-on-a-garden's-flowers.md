<p class="hanging">Flowers in the colors of</p>
<p class="hanging">highschool; I try to see them another way</p>
<p class="hanging">but there they are—concession stands painted,</p>
<p class="hanging">banners in the halls my feet remember.</p>
<p class="hanging">I see these flowers, knights of a faded gold,</p>
<p class="hanging">seated on their horses all of purple.</p>

<br>

<p class="hanging">But you see in that purple </p>
<p class="hanging">something I don’t know the colors of—</p>
<p class="hanging">the sky the night your father died, when the gold</p>
<p class="hanging">sun rose & burned the silence in the way;</p>
<p class="hanging">you hear the decades-muted voice, remember</p>
<p class="hanging">the dirges, the happy-birthdays it painted.</p>

<br>

<p class="hanging">And all these things are painted;</p>
<p class="hanging">no heaven blazes forth from that bright purple,</p>
<p class="hanging">these stars in commons violet don’t remember</p>
<p class="hanging">the namesake days, the princely colors of;</p>
<p class="hanging">they lack the finger joints to count the ways</p>
<p class="hanging">time’s bankers have been light the promised gold.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">And what’s in the hour’s gold</p>
<p class="hanging">but flowers’ bloom by other brushes painted?</p>
<p class="hanging">All princely glory’s nothing but the way</p>
<p class="hanging">the light beds down in petal-folds of purple—</p>
<p class="hanging">swaddling robes, spun in the colors of</p>
<p class="hanging">tired eyes that un-nursed nights remember.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">But if eyes can remember</p>
<p class="hanging">in those rude hours the afterglow of gold,</p>
<p class="hanging">why can’t the flowers know the colors of</p>
<p class="hanging">their hands—outstretched for alms, daily painted</p>
<p class="hanging">in yellow grace & sunk again in purple—</p>
<p class="hanging">do they see nothing of the brighted way?</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">All things see that spring light’s way;</p>
<p class="hanging">these flowers drink the world & do remember</p>
<p class="hanging">in their purple selves a younger purple,</p>
<p class="hanging">seeds of themselves that dreamed the promised gold,</p>
<p class="hanging">dreamed your father’s grave a garden painted</p>
<p class="hanging">in highschools, the flowering colors of.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">When these colors of late spring go the way</p>
<p class="hanging">of all things painted, I will remember</p>
<p class="hanging">them as knights of gold on horses purple.</p>
