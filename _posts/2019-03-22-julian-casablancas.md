![Julian Casablancas is an American singer & songwriter.][1]

Julian Casablancas is a name everyone should know. Casablancas is the lead singer of The Voidz & The Strokes, and also released an impressive solo album, Phrazes for the Young, in 2009. He is an extremely talented vocalist, and his lyrics get at the very heart of contemporary culture. His song “River of Brakelights” is, in my view, a profound commentary on the technological and economic forces driving the modern world.

A few lines, in particular, distinguish the clarity of Casablancas’ vision of American culture from that of the run-of-the-mill social critic.

> *“I shop therefore I am the cause*
> *Protect me from what I was”*

A play on Descartes’ “I think therefore I am,” Casablancas calls out the proclivity of contemporary culture to reduce people to their purchases as consumers – and for people to do this implicitly to <i>themselves</i> – rather than imbuing them with deeper purpose or showing an appreciation for the richness of conscious experience. Where we might identify with our inmost beliefs & ideas or with the relationships & experiences which color our lives, we are instead preoccupied with the brands of our clothing & the gadgets in our pockets. We have alienated ourselves from our full humanity, & many of us do not understand or do not want to understand what it would mean to live our lives in service of a higher aim. The rapid advancements of the last 150 years have not come without their costs.

> *“I'm at your feet, where critters meet*
> *Who should be asleep and not crossing roads or highways”*

Anyone who has been behind the wheel on an American highway has seen the carnage. Casablancas recalls once more the alienation from nature our technology-driven society has produced. At whose feet he is I’m not sure, though Mother Nature springs to mind. Certainly, a plea such as this would be well addressed to the mother whose children are ground beneath the wheels of forces they do not understand. In this regard, it is not only four-legged critters who have been displaced, but we two-legged ones as well.

> *“In the afterlife of super cities, rapidly devouring its outskirts*
> *Its neon octopus arms redecorating late at night”*

The imagery in these lines is extremely evocative. Pay close attention the next time you travel from a suburban area into the city, or vice versa. I’m sure you will see the “neon octopus arms” stretching out from the city center, “rapidly devouring its outskirts.” Urban sprawl, some have called it. Casablancas really brings the idea to life in a way which captures its creeping, expanding essence. The chaotic & chromatic section which follows develops it even further.

The sense of hopelessness Casablancas expresses in River of Brakelights is as brilliant as it is painful. Its excellent writing, brilliant vocal performance, and addictively catchy chorus have brought my thumb to the repeat button on more than one occasion.
