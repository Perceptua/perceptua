The pantoum is derived from a Malay verse form. I read about this form during
the summer of 2023 & began straightaway to experiment. I found that the
composition of pantoums presented certain challenges to the poet, the
surmounting of which demanded uncommon modes of thought. Pantoums may progress
forward or backward, or outward in both directions from their center, depending
on the poet's approach. The ambiguities involved, the collisions between fronts
of meaning, heightened my interest in these poems, & the nature of the form
itself. I had been numbering lines as an aid to composition, & I carried this
practice into a graphical & analytical investigation of the pantoumâ€™s internal
structures. I wrote it all down in a mottled dialect combining poetry &
mathematics, which the mathematician will find unenlightening, & the poet quite
tedious. Yet the mathematician should recognize that the core of his work is
poetry, & the poet should unstop his ears to the music of number. That greater
mathematicians & poets than I may be encouraged to work on this form, I publish
here my treatise [on the structure of the pantoum][1]{:target="_blank"}.
