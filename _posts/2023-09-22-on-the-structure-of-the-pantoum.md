Some months ago I read about the pantoum & began experimenting with the form. The composition of pantoums presents interesting challenges to the poet, the surmounting of which demands uncommon modes of thought. The poem may progress forward & backward, or outward in two directions from its center, depending on the poet's approach. The ambiguities involved, the collisions between fronts of meaning, heightened my interest in these poems, & the nature of the form itself. I had been numbering lines as an aid to composition, & I carried this practice into a graphical & analytical investigation of the pantoum's internal structures. I have written it all down in a mottled dialect combining poetry & mathematics, which the mathematician may find unenlightening & the poet may find quite tedious. Yet the mathematician should recognize that the core of his work is poetry, & the poet should unstop his ears to the music of number. That greater mathematicians & poets than myself may be encouraged to work on this form, I publish here my treatise <a target="_blank" href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/perceptua-b6ea3.appspot.com/o/public%2FOn_the_Structure_of_the_Pantoum.pdf?alt=media&token=cec9924f-b767-48f5-a6a2-4908db74de03">on the structure of the pantoum</a>.
