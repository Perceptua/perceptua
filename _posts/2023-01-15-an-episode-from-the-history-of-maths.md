<p class="hanging">A Norwegian came close, but he died of the lung</p>
<p class="hanging">before he saw it in its fullness—or perhaps watched</p>
<p class="hanging">while the light went, the blood at the edge of his mouth.</p>
<p class="hanging">The poets wept, the mathematicians back to work;</p>
<p class="hanging">they'd hacked their names in time, but with this death</p>
<p class="hanging">they'd dash their brains on walls eternal, crying</p>
<p class="hanging">giddy thanks forever—forever shrinks & shrinks.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">A child young & French has it almost in his hands,</p>
<p class="hanging">sees it dance on the ceiling of some nowhere at night</p>
<p class="hanging">like the gift-bearing hands of the angels.</p>
<p class="hanging">And the mathematicians quail at this thing</p>
<p class="hanging">they cannot see & suppose him a Nordic ghost.</p>
<p class="hanging">And they feign & cannot read his papers,</p>
<p class="hanging">& they visit him not in prison,</p>
<p class="hanging">& they rejoice when he's shot</p>
<p class="hanging">dueling for coquette honor.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Lungs drain in the softness of grass,</p>
<p class="hanging">the poets weep, the mathematicians work.</p>
<p class="hanging">And time & the devil get up to their tricks,</p>
<p class="hanging">& we thrash against believing in the demiurge.</p>
