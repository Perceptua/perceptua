<p class="hanging">A Nord came close in the 20s, but he died of the lung</p>
<p class="hanging">before he saw its fullnessâ€”or perhaps he watched</p>
<p class="hanging">while the light went, the blood at the edge</p>
<p class="hanging">of his mouth. The poets wept. The mathematicians</p>
<p class="hanging">back to work; they'd hacked their names in time,</p>
<p class="hanging">but with this death they'd dash their brains on walls</p>
<p class="hanging">eternal, crying their giddy thanks. But forever's short.</p>
<p class="hanging">Some child young & French has it almost in his hands,</p>
<p class="hanging">sees it dance on the ceiling of some nowhere at night</p>
<p class="hanging">like the gift-bearing hands of the angels.</p>
<p class="hanging">And the mathematicians quail at this thing</p>
<p class="hanging">they cannot see; they suppose him a Nordic ghost.</p>
<p class="hanging">And they feign they cannot see his papers,</p>
<p class="hanging">& they visit him not in prison,</p>
<p class="hanging">& they rejoice when he's shot</p>
<p class="hanging">dueling for coquette honor.</p>
<p class="hanging">The blood leaves his lungs for the softness of the grass,</p>
<p class="hanging">the poets weep, the mathematicians work.</p>
<p class="hanging">And time & the devil get up to their tricks,</p>
<p class="hanging">& we thrash against believing in the demiurge.</p>
