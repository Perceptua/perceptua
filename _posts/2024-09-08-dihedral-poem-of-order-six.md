            The scheme of the preceding poem is based on D<sub>3</sub>, the
            dihedral group of order 6. D<sub>3</sub> can be thought of as the
            group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. These symmetries are
            used in the poem's construction to determine the positions of
            certain "vertex" words within each stanza. The rules for this
            dihedral poem are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                Stanzas are of 3 lines, each line having 9 syllables.
            </li>
            <li>
                From the first stanza, 3 vertex words are selected:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                        The word which begins with syllable 1 of line 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The word which contains syllable 5 of line 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The word which ends with syllable 9 of line 3.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                These vertex words are considered to be equidistant "points"
                within the stanza, & are mapped onto the vertices of an
                equilateral triangle.
            </li>
            <li>
                The initial arrangement of vertices is taken to be the element
                R<sub>0</sub> of D<sub>3</sub>. In all stanzas following the
                first, the positions of the vertex words are interchanged
                according to the remaining rotations & reflections of
                D<sub>3</sub>.
            </li>
        </ol>
