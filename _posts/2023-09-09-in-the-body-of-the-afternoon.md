<p class="hanging">In the body of the afternoon</p>
<p class="hanging">the treebark lines my back, the grass my legs;</p>
<p class="hanging">the weaving of the net is pressed in flesh. So</p>
<p class="hanging">graves cry out their names through carving's scars.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">The treebark lines my back, the grass my legs;</p>
<p class="hanging">the day grows on but I sink into dreams where</p>
<p class="hanging">graves cry out their names through carving's scars</p>
<p class="hanging">& virgins burn like torches for the nearing.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">The day grows on but I sink into dreams where</p>
<p class="hanging">God draws in the dark that holds the stars</p>
<p class="hanging">& virgins burn like torches for the nearing</p>
<p class="hanging">fall, the missiles of the choking night.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">God draws in the dark that holds the stars,</p>
<p class="hanging">the weaving of the net is pressed in flesh. So</p>
<p class="hanging">fall, you missiles of the choking night,</p>
<p class="hanging">in the body of the afternoon.</p>
