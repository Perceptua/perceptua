<p class="hanging">I arrived, some creature at last delivered,</p>
<p class="hanging">thrown up on heaven's shores</p>
<p class="hanging">still soaked in space & time.</p>
<p class="hanging">I was ill-composed then, & never so far</p>
<p class="hanging">from the image God had spoken.</p>
<p class="hanging">Whatever faults & unrealities</p>
<p class="hanging">had crept into that picture robed in flesh,</p>
<p class="hanging">these were as things beloved, </p>
<p class="hanging">without any need of forgiveness;</p>
<p class="hanging">but my life, the choices I did not have to makeâ€¦</p>
<br><br>
<p class="hanging">My name was read from the book.</p>
<p class="hanging">It was not the crude thing </p>
<p class="hanging">I knew & have known again,</p>
<p class="hanging">but a word of a single syllable, a note.</p>
<p class="hanging">In the voice that sang from eternity</p>
<p class="hanging">I heard again the falling </p>
<p class="hanging">of my feet upon the earth,</p>
<p class="hanging">saw the low sun through yellowing leaves.</p>
<p class="hanging">In its song were all the movements of my soul,</p>
<p class="hanging">& I was called to what awaited.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="hanging">Tearfully I pleaded not to go, & what I asked was given;</p>
<p class="hanging">I did not sit then in the place He set for me.</p>
<p class="hanging">So weigh once more upon me my tattered weaving;</p>
<p class="hanging">we go to sing His praises all our days.</p>
