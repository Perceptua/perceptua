A while ago I was reading one of those books for boys, a tale of wizards & knights. Midway upon his journey our hero sat with a friend on a cart of fruit—mangoes, as I recall—& with their knives they carved the fruit to eat it. By the author's treatment of this scene I was filled with hope, imagining the ease & romance of a life fed entirely on mangoes.

So I bought mangoes & brought out my knife, the same little paring knife from the same set everyone has. Cutting into the flesh of the first fruit, all my daydreams & sweet-smelling idylls ran out on the counter just cleaned. Here was no rest, but sticky toil.

But I must be doing it wrong.

So I went back to that book for boys, & read again the passage on the carving of fruit. When I closed the book I had lost everything. My pleasant impressions were no more; instead I was incensed with the author of those words, for in all his talk of the cart full of mangoes & the taste of the mangoes & the wiping of juice from the blade, he never spoke once of the method, the craft, the *techne* of carving a mango. I forgave him, of course, when I recalled this was no treatise in pomospathology, but a tale of wizards & knights. But all the same, I felt the boys he wrote the book for would appreciate some pointers in form.

Well, I fetched a notebook & laid it open on the counter with the mangoes & the little paring knife & I set to work annotating the struggle of the fruit & the blade. I'd decided I would write the definitive text for any wizard or knight on the ergonomical carving of mangoes.

This is not that text.

That text—with its introduction & bibliography, its manuscript illuminations, its critical apparatus—I have wisely consigned to the trash. In the last days of its composition, I happened to read in Borges that to pen vast books is an impoverishing madness, & having begun with no great stock of wealth or wit I felt I could risk nothing further. Also, I don't much care for mangoes. No, reader, this is not that text. This text is the branch bearing other fruits; this text is the branch grafted in. This text—O reader, this text!—is the apodeictic, the apotheosis of the science of carving a grapefruit.

### 1.

Begin with your grapefruit & your knife. Take also a plate with a raised lip & a little cup, to be placed in the center of the plate with the raised lip. These will serve to collect the juices of the grapefruit.

### 2.

Place the grapefruit on the plate with the raised lip (the little cup being set aside) & quarter it vertically with the knife.

### 3.

Stack the quartered grapefruit to one side of the plate with the raised lip, & place the little cup on the other.

### 4.

Holding one quarter of the grapefruit horizontally above the little cup, cut any albedo that clings to the central ridge.

### 5.

Make a semicircular cut behind the endocarp to disgorge that edible fruit. Cut close, leaving behind as little fruit & as much albedo as possible.

### 6.

Remove & discard any seeds, albedo, or membrane still clinging to the disgorged endocarp.

### 7.

Consume the disgorged endocarp.

### 8.

If any fruit remains attached to the flavedo, hold the excavated husk over the little cup & fold it in half vertically. Squeeze the flavedo & allow the juices to run into the little cup.

### 9.

Excarpate & juice the three remaining quarters of the grapefruit. You have now eaten more endocarp than ever before in your life, & have yet a fine cordial of the little cup.
