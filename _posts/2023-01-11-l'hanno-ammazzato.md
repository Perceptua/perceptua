<p class="hanging">The Catholic knife of Ravaillac struck heart at ides of May;</p>
<p class="hanging">from a palace window they cried the Queen l'hanno ammazzato.</p>
<p class="hanging">And the seer, the prophetess tore at their eyes—having seen it, to see it again—</p>
<p class="hanging">& the blood of the King ran cobblestone channels, gone fore & back through time.</p>
<p class="hanging">Fingers curled, unclurled & slowed, & pointed like a gun on a bridge</p>
<p class="hanging">at the day they'd cry l'hanno ammazzato to the Queen from a palace window—</p>
<p class="hanging">& she would watch the sorceress tear at her eyes, her lover's blood</p>
<p class="hanging">run back the years accusing.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">And other Mays & ides will see the rivers run uphill</p>
<p class="hanging">from the scaffold of a satire, the feet of a bald Calvinist & silent;</p>
<p class="hanging">& the run-together blood will carry you off, you broad-faced maiden—</p>
<p class="hanging">from your throat you'll bear his children, ...</p>
<p class="hanging">...</p>
<p class="hanging">And against the prophets we'll drink a playwright's memory,</p>
<p class="hanging">like lowland thieves of mercy set him naked on stage & stage—</p>
<p class="hanging">the ides of another month.</p>
