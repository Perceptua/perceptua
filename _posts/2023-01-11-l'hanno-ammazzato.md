<p class="hanging">The Catholic knife of Ravaillac struck heart at ides of May;</p>
<p class="hanging">from a palace window they cried the Queen l'hanno ammazzato.</p>
<p class="hanging">And the seer, the prophetess tore at their eyes—having seen it, they see it again—</p>
<p class="hanging">& the cobblestone drank the King.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Fingers curled, unclurled & slowed, & pointed like a gun on a bridge</p>
<p class="hanging">at the day they'd cry l'hanno ammazzato to the Queen—</p>
<p class="hanging">& she would watch the sorceress tear at her eyes, her lover's blood</p>
<p class="hanging">run back the years, accusing.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">And other Mays & ides will see the rivers run uphill</p>
<p class="hanging">from the scaffold of a satire to the feet of a silent Calvanist;</p>
<p class="hanging">& the run-together blood will carry you off, you broad-faced maiden—</p>
<p class="hanging">from your throat you'll bear his children.</p>
