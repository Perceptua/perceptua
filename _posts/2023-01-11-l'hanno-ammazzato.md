<p class="hanging">The Catholic knife of Ravaillac struck heart at ides of May;</p>
<p class="hanging">from a palace window the lover of the Queen cried l'hanno ammazzato.</p>
<p class="hanging">And the seer, the prophetess tore at their eyes—having seen it, to see it again—</p>
<p class="hanging">& the blood of the King ran cobblestone channels, gone fore & back through time.</p>
<p class="hanging">Its fingers curled, unclurled & slowed, & pointed like a gun on a bridge</p>
<p class="hanging">at a day when they would shout l'hanno ammazzato to the queen from a palace window—</p>
<p class="hanging">& she would watch the sorceress tear at her eyes, her lover's blood run back the years accusing.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="hanging">And other Mays & ides will see the rivers run uphill</p>
<p class="hanging">from the scaffold of a satire, the feet of a bald Calvinist & silent.</p>
<p class="hanging">And the run-together blood will carry you off, you broad-faced maiden,</p>
<p class="hanging">& you will bear his children while his blood pours out libations on the earth.</p>
<p class="hanging">And against the prophets we'll drink, remember never knowing</p>
<p class="hanging">the playwright come to court, by lowland thieves of mercy set naked on stage & stage—</p>
<p class="hanging">the ides, the ides, the ides of another month.</p>
