<p class="hanging">Still snows come down on March.</p>
<p class="hanging">The flowers early sprung</p>
<p class="hanging">have strown themselves upon</p>
<p class="hanging">the death-arisen grasses.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">The flowers early sprung,</p>
<p class="hanging">the birds too early singing;</p>
<p class="hanging">the death-arisen grasses</p>
<p class="hanging">press with lamentations.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">The birds too early singing</p>
<p class="hanging">frost-choked threnodies</p>
<p class="hanging">press with lamentations</p>
<p class="hanging">the tomb of the twice-dead grass.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Frost-choked threnodies</p>
<p class="hanging">have strown themselves upon</p>
<p class="hanging">the tomb of the twice-dead grass.</p>
<p class="hanging">Still snows come down on March.</p>
