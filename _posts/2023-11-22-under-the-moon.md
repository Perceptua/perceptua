<p><i>Under the Moon Reading Yeats' "Under the Moon"</i></p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">The waters of the ground are hung in air;</p>
<p class="hanging">the porchlights fashion diadems of gold,</p>
<p class="hanging">the moon plaits hers of silver </p>
<p class="hanging">in hair that drops like tears.</p>
<p class="hanging">The trees are rivers black in the river Night—</p>
<p class="hanging">run slow to seem asleep, trickle as to seem</p>
<p class="hanging">a corse of dreams, let blood by the leeches of time.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Stirring are the purpling tongues of poets,</p>
<p class="hanging">memory plies her constellating arts,</p>
<p class="hanging">yet all things run together—the elixir is a healer not of us;</p>
<p class="hanging">it is drunk by the earth to the last, the very last;</p>
<p class="hanging">the sun will come & find no mist to burn.</p>
