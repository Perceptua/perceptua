<p class="hanging">I am a child for whom the pages are not less than the book,</p>
<p class="hanging">for whom the days are not smaller than dreams.</p>
<p class="hanging">Yesterday in the dream of a prophet I read of Al-Kawthar,</p>
<p class="hanging">which means the abundant & God-given good</p>
<p class="hanging">or perhaps a single river in Paradise.</p>
<p class="hanging">But all rivers are the river platonic, the river of the mind of God;</p>
<p class="hanging">in Chios he sang of a god who was a river, of his wrath.</p>
<p class="hanging">And what is the river that circles the world but a mirror?</p>
<p class="hanging">Ocean may be the ocean or the ungraspable phantom of life,</p>
<p class="hanging">all her intangible malignity but a white ubiquitous whale;</p>
<p class="hanging">& I may be a morsel in her belly, carried unawares to Nineveh</p>
<p class="hanging">to be reborn a symbol & a sign.</p>
