<p class="hanging">I thought of going back home</p>
<p class="hanging">One weekend near the end of October</p>
<p class="hanging">And walking again through the woods. I thought</p>
<p class="hanging">I'd find the rocks in habits of pale green,</p>
<p class="hanging">The knots of trees more gnarled, their shadows</p>
<p class="hanging">Sewing hems on the frayed train of the sun.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">And I found the tattered sun</p>
<p class="hanging">Draped over things I half-believed were home</p>
<p class="hanging">At second glance. The arabesquing shadows</p>
<p class="hanging">Beckoned to the dance of past Octobers,</p>
<p class="hanging">When maples held their leaves for evergreen</p>
<p class="hanging">And had their sugared arms broke for the thought;</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Heavy fell the snows they thought</p>
<p class="hanging">Were weeks away. The cauterizing sun</p>
<p class="hanging">Has closed those wounds, but underneath new green</p>
<p class="hanging">Has suckled of its rays & made a home.</p>
<p class="hanging">This too proffers hubris to October,</p>
<p class="hanging">And soon must pay support to pregnant shadows.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Yet now I find the shadows</p>
<p class="hanging">All unpeopled. Gone the shades of thought</p>
<p class="hanging">That budded Mays & reddened with Octobers,</p>
<p class="hanging">That cast out from their hands expiring suns.</p>
<p class="hanging">Prodigalling toward their darkened home,</p>
<p class="hanging">I spot the razing thorns that clothe the green.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">How like memory this green,</p>
<p class="hanging">That late seems young & lowly hides in shadows</p>
<p class="hanging">Spurred contortions in the spines of things. Home</p>
<p class="hanging">My body far from here, that worming thought</p>
<p class="hanging">Not eat my shapely bones, but let the sun</p>
<p class="hanging">Bathe them dry & bright as an October.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Let's ossify, October.</p>
<p class="hanging">Make this ground unworkable to the green</p>
<p class="hanging">That spins & would encrypt us from the sun.</p>
<p class="hanging">Shed the leaves that corporate your shadows,</p>
<p class="hanging">And I will bare my mind of cloying thought;</p>
<p class="hanging">We'll strip these rocks of moss & found a home.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">October, thin the darkness of your shadow;</p>
<p class="hanging">Press flat the green with winter-nearing thoughts;</p>
<p class="hanging">Let sunlight fill the mansions of our home.</p>
