<p class="hanging">
  The men returned somberly to her table;<br>
  they’d leave to dying Chance her mute affections.<br>
  The one who’d seen her first had choice of arms—<br>
  with deference & calm he chose the latter’s.<br>
  The gun slipped from its holster to the table—<br>
  no more noise than setting down a glass.<br>
  <br>
  She performed the honors:<br>
  flicked the cylinder open with her wrist,<br>
  chambered lead by late-admirer offered,<br>
  spun the drum with force & watched it slow,<br>
  locked it into place.<br>
  <br>
  The metal slithered across the table spinning;<br>
  no clock would turn such heavy, merciless time.<br>
  The gentle breath of Fate blew soft, then stopped—<br>
  the barrel pointed resolute & sure.<br>
  <br>
  “Madam, for your love,” the former spoke,<br>
  “I die one time in six”—the hammer fell.<br>
  The gun changed hands, the ritual repeated.<br>
  <br>
  Revolver’s rattle five times spared its fangs;<br>
  the latter, longing, gazed into her eyes.<br>
  <br>
  “Madam, for your love, one time in one.”<br>
