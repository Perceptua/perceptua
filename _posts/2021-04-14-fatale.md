<p class="hanging">The men returned somberly to her table;</p>
<p class="hanging">they’d leave to dying chance her mute affections.</p>
<p class="hanging">The one who’d seen her first had choice of arms—</p>
<p class="hanging">with deference & calm he chose the latter’s.</p>
<p class="hanging">The gun slipped from its holster to the table—</p>
<p class="hanging">no more noise than setting down a glass.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">She performed the honors:</p>
<p class="hanging">flicked the cylinder open with her wrist,</p>
<p class="hanging">chambered lead by late-admirer offered,</p>
<p class="hanging">spun the drum with force & watched it slow,</p>
<p class="hanging">locked it into place.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">The metal slithered cross the table spinning;</p>
<p class="hanging">no clock would turn such heavy, merciless time.</p>
<p class="hanging">The gentle breath of Fate blew soft, then stopped—</p>
<p class="hanging">the barrel pointed resolute & sure.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">“Madam, for your love,” the former spoke,</p>
<p class="hanging">“I die one time in six”—the hammer fell.</p>
<p class="hanging">The gun changed hands, the ritual repeated.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">Revolver’s rattle five times spared its fangs;</p>
<p class="hanging">the latter longing-gazed into her eyes.</p>
<br>
<p class="hanging">“Madam, for your love, one time in one.”</p>
