The men returned somberly to her table;  
they’d leave to dying Chance her mute affections.  
The one who’d seen her first had choice of arms—  
with deference & calm he chose the latter’s.  
The gun slipped from its holster to the table—  
no more noise than setting down a glass.  

She performed the honors:  
flicked the cylinder open with her wrist,  
chambered lead by late-admirer offered,  
spun the drum with force & watched it slow,  
locked it into place.  

The metal slithered across the table spinning;  
no clock would turn such heavy, merciless time.  
The gentle breath of Fate blew soft, then stopped—  
the barrel pointed resolute & sure.  

“Madam, for your love,” the former spoke,  
“I die one time in six”—the hammer fell.  
The gun changed hands, the ritual repeated.  

Revolver’s rattle five times spared its fangs;  
the latter, longing, gazed into her eyes.  

“Madam, for your love, one time in one.”
