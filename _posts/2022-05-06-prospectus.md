<p class="hanging">I’ve moved to a new town of late—</p>
<p class="hanging">a suburb place, hemmed by septentrion highways</p>
<p class="hanging">& fields of corn that stretch the south queen’s way.</p>
<p class="hanging">I’ve started running streets at night—</p>
<p class="hanging">the side streets with no signs of enterprise.</p>
<p class="hanging">But I hear as I run from pole to pole,</p>
<p class="hanging">from wires slack then cresting overhead,</p>
<p class="hanging">the hidden commerce coursing through the lines.</p>
<p class="hanging">The streetlights hum like bugs,</p>
<p class="hanging">the houses through their windows softly breathing</p>
<p class="hanging">fan the sidewalks’ low moon-kindled lustre.</p>
<p class="hanging">My shadow follows feet with lights their lead;</p>
<p class="hanging">I am a gust, a wreck on the quiet rolling</p>
<p class="hanging">of the waves that lap the treetops overhead.</p>
