<p class="hanging">
I’ve moved to a new town of late—<br>
a suburb place, hemmed by septentrion highways<br>
& fields of corn that stretch the south queen’s way.<br>
I’ve started running streets at night—<br>
the side streets with no signs of enterprise.<br>
But I hear as I run from pole to pole,<br>
from wires slack then cresting overhead,<br>
the hidden commerce coursing through the lines.<br>
The streetlights hum like bugs,<br>
the houses through their windows softly breathing<br>
fan the sidewalks’ low moon-kindled lustre.<br>
My shadow follows feet with lights their lead;<br>
I am a gust, a wreck on the quiet rolling<br>
of the waves that lap the treetops overhead.<br>
