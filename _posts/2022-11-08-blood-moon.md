<p class="hanging">I’m looking for the blood moon in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="hanging">I can’t see shit under these streetlights;</p>
<p class="hanging">then my dog shits under a streetlight.</p>
<p class="hanging">We head for the receptacle of custom & waste,</p>
<p class="hanging">but I spy the local news, their stadium of lights</p>
<p class="hanging">on a war horse diesel generator, the laser sight</p>
<p class="hanging">of their shoulder-mount telescope trained on the earth—</p>
<p class="hanging">I decide to find another place for shit.</p>
<p class="hanging">On the next street a man is walking</p>
<p class="hanging">in a reflector vest inlaid with red lightbars.</p>
<p class="hanging">This guy’s a vein, he’s looking for the blood moon.</p>
<p class="hanging">I follow his cardiovasculations like a wounded animal,</p>
<p class="hanging">a bird I shot once wishing it was over.</p>
<p class="hanging">Then a woman in a scarlet robe steps into the street,</p>
<p class="hanging">says in the voice you fear she’d have</p>
<p class="hanging">I’m looking for the blood moon.</p>
<p class="hanging">I point in her direction—it’s over there.</p>
<p class="hanging">The crone spits into her hand & makes a sign;</p>
<p class="hanging">as fortune I was a harlot & a wife,</p>
<p class="hanging">as chance I’m a loveless fickle mistress—</p>
<p class="hanging">there’s blood everywhere, but no heart left to break.</p>
<p class="hanging">I saw the blood moon dull & setting.</p>
